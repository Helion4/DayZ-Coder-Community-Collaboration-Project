# Coder Community Collaboration Project for DayZ SA


## Main Information:
### Please follow any and all directions as they are written. Please understand that other scripts that are not made compatible with CCCP might not function due to a dual usage of common overrides such as InvokeOnConnect, OnInit and many more. Understand that you might have to merge overrides together in order to make the new script fully compatible. We have tried to make overrides as easy to find and edit as possible, just check the "overrides" folder in the mission file. Need to configure a script, just look in the configs folder! simple and easy.


## For Your Eyes Only:
### The CCCP framework is geared for efficiency, easy to use/install/modify/upgrade, and vastly customizable mission framework for DayZ SA(WIP)

### Installation:
#### Coming Soon with public announcement
